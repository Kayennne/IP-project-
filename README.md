<h1>REACH Website</h1>
<p>This website is made to allow parents or soon-to-be parents to easily share information with one another. The website lets parents with queries ask questions about parenting for other parents to see, the more experience parent can then give information and advise about the problems faced. Other parents with the same question will be able to see the answer, allowing parents to help each other.</p>

<br>

<h2>Design Process<h2>
<p>This website was made for easy communication between struggling parents so that they will be able to find answers from other parents that they are unable to find online.<p>
<br>
<p> - As a single parent, I would love to be abe to ask question about parenting as well as answer those struggles which I have faced before to help other parents out there..</p>
<br>
<p> - As a soon-to-be parent, I would love to be able to read on the experiences of other parents to know what I should take note of when my baby arrives.</p>
<br>
<p> - As a parent of 3, I would love to be able to share my experience and help other parents overcome their struggles.</p>
